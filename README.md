## ðŸ’» Project summary

The act of 'mining' a bitcoin is basically finding a unique number that, when added to the payload of a
block, produces a final hash that follows a specific rule. In the case of bitcoin, this rule says that the final hash must start with a number of N zeros.

This is an excellent case for parallel processing, because it is a process that takes time and requires heavier computation. Let's simplify the mining model and abstract the core functionality into code that's simpler to understand and focus on our workers. Our â€˜minerâ€™ will receive a JSON with the os for this file symbolizes a series of payloads of different blocks.

## :video_game: How to play

Clone this project and run the command:

````npm
node index.js
````
and watch the mining happen by creating a hash for guy "bitcoin"

## ðŸ›  Technologies
